    "For this practice, a dataset consisting of five files has been provided, each corresponding to a different driver (Driver1-5). For each driver, there are five Excel files containing data collected during the execution of five different driving maneuvers:\n",
    "- Overtaking.\n",
    "- Stopping.\n",
    "- Turning.\n",
    "- Three-step turn.\n",
    "- U-turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file follows a uniform format, where each row represents a time instance, and each column stores the value of a signal recorded at that moment. A total of 22 different signals have been collected, although only the following will be used in this practice:\n",
    "- Speed – Vehicle speed.\n",
    "- RPM – Revolutions per minute.\n",
    "- Steering Wheel Angle – Steering wheel angle.\n",
    "- Gas Pedal – Accelerator pedal.\n",
    "- Brake Pedal – Brake pedal.\n",
    "- Clutch Pedal – Clutch pedal.\n",
    "- Gear – Gear position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the \"Maneuver Marker Flag\" column indicates the execution of a maneuver at each time instance. Its value is 1 when the corresponding maneuver is in progress and 0 when it is not.\n",
    "It is worth noting that the data has a high sampling frequency, recording values 20 times per second for each driver and maneuver."
